This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ctv)
install.views("Spatial") 
```
```{r}
class(cars)
```
```{r}
summary(cars)
```
```{r}
str(cars)
```
```{r}
plot(cars$dist, cars$speed)
```

Stop at 2.3: Spatial Objects

```{r}
library(sp)
getClass("Spatial")
```
```{r}
m <- matrix(c(0,0,1,1), ncol = 2, dimnames = list(NULL, c("min", "max")))
crs <- CRS(projargs = as.character(NA))
crs
S <- Spatial(bbox = m, proj4string = crs)
S
```
```{r}
save.image("~/rspatial")
```
```{r}
load("~/rspatialTmp")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
